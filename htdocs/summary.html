<h2>Project summary</h2>
The <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphafold">AlphaFold</a> predicted protein structure from <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> (15,911 proteins) and Fusarium parasiticus (17,356 proteins) were aligned against nine proteomes using the software <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek">FoldSeek</a>. The protein structure data for this project was downloaded from Google Cloud (version 4 - January 2023). The nine proteomes include five strains of Fusarium (<i>A. flavus</i>, <i>F. fujikuroi</i>, <i>F. oxysporum</i>, <i>F. proliferatum</i>, <i>F. solani</i>, <i>F. parasiticus</i>. Four well-annotated proteomes were chosen as outgroups: <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Arabidopsis), <i>Homo sapiens</i> (Human), <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (Budding yeast), <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> (Fission yeast). The output HTML from FoldSeek was modified to include the top 25 hits from each species with <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=*">Uniprot functional annotations</a>, species information, and blue/red color gradient.<br/>
